# DjangoRESTAPI

Building a RESTful API with Django to better understand how an API operates and how to acess data through it. 

To test this project you will need Django installed. You can find out how to do this here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/windows/ If you are not on windows, just use the sidebar menu to search for the installation guide for your OS.

Run the project by typing the command "python manage.py runserver" in the mysite folder. The API will be hosted in your localhost and can be used instantly.

In order to execute this project you will need Python installed in your computer. In order to edit or complement the code you will need a text editor or IDE of your choice. I recommend Jetbrains Pycharm. You can find links to install these features below:
